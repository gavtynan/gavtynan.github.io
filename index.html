			  <h3>Code Things</h3>
			  <p>I've devoted 7 years of my life to programming so hopefully there's something to show for it...</p>

			<div id="AboutMe" class="tabcontent">
			  <h3>My Story</h3>
			  <p>I've lived a hell of a life, come read about it...</p>

			  <p>This section is going to take me a long time to write so work with me here. It will by nature never be finished as long as I'm alive. The combination of this with the Brain Stream section will give you an depth look into my mind.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>Gavin Patrick Tynan, borin April 17, 2001 on Long Island, New York. Second child born to Kevin and Illyse Tynan, brother of Zack. This is the only surface level aspect of my life does not contribute to my current state. In terms of Nature vs Nurture, this covers none of it. I have lived an eventful life for the last 20 years. More expiriences than most 20 year olds have faced. And most not particularly beeing positive but beneficial in some way. A couple points before the beef of this starts:</p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>My speciality is math and logic so forgive any grammatical or syntax errors and if you're going to make your judgements and critiques based on them, fuck off, this isn't for you</li>
			  	<li>I hate to bring this part up but it is essential to the understanding. I have an IQ of 127. That is higher than 95% of the population. That is not a brag and I strongly dislike bringing it up but is very important to take that into account as you are reading.</li>
			  	<li>I am bipolar, my mood switches and my writing tone follows. Some areas of this will be written in short and rapid sentences. Some will be written with a lot of swears. Some will be written with long and deep sentences. Learn to live with it, I did.</li>
			  	<li>This is my view of life through my lens. If you disagree with anything or dislike it. Congrats, you aren't for me and this isn't for you.</li>
			  </ul>

			  <p>Ok, let's get this shit show underway. Born the younger sibling in the family, I was one happy motherfucker. Always active and energetic, loving my innocent life. It was simple. I come from a fortunate family so there never was any issue with my wants and needs. I lived in a small town on Long Island where I could always ride my bike to see my friends.</p>
